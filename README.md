# A MERN STACK MUSIC PLAYER

<p>This project is a full-stack web application built using the MERN stack, which consists of MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. It aims to provide a seamless and efficient user experience while demonstrating a robust architecture and modern web development practices. In addition to the core MERN technologies, I utilized TypeScript for type safety, Mongoose for MongoDB object modeling, Cloudinary for media management, and styling libraries like Tailwind CSS and Emotion for responsive and dynamic design.</p>
